## 🛠️ Tasks Overview
🛠️ Tasks Overview
Task No.	Task Title	
Task 1	CGPA Calculator
Developed a C++ program to calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on user-input subject grades and credits. 
The program validates inputs, computes total grade points, and displays the final CGPA accurately. 
This task focuses on basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and control structures in C++.
Task 2	Login & Registration System
Created a console-based Login and Registration System using C++. 
The system allows users to register by storing credentials and later log in using valid credentials. 
This task emphasizes file handling, conditional logic, and basic authentication concepts while maintaining data persistence.
Task 3	Sudoku Solver	
Implemented a Sudoku Solver using C++ that automatically solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle. 
The solution uses backtracking algorithms to place numbers while satisfying Sudoku rules. 
This task enhances understanding of recursion, algorithms, and advanced problem-solving techniques.
